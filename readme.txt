Please contact daveaite@gmail.com and describe your issue further.

= How did you determine 85% to admins? =

We price the products low and affordable for users to get their prints. 85% is a large chunk of the earnings when a majority of the cost goes to the creation of the actual print, shipping, developer and operational costs.

Yes, this is a very easy way of integrating a powerful, yet easy money making suystem on your site.

= How does installing the Print Money plugin change the appearance of my website? =

The look of your site does not change, but visitors who hover over a picture will see a “Print Me” button. On mobile devices, a long tap shows the Print button. As the site owner or administrator, you can determine which pages display the print button, and how the button looks

= What is the minimum size my photos must be to allow them to be printed on one or more products? =
The minimum size picture that can be placed on an order is 400 x 400 pixels. This is roughly 4 inches x 4 inches.

The Print Money plugin will measure each picture for you and will not display the “Print Me“button if the photo is too small.

Print Money is based on the idea that most people are printing one special picture. However, we intend to add the ability to choose more than one photo from a gallery or web site in the future.

Shipping is based on the actual cost of shipping by UPS or US mail. dotPhoto does not mark up shipping.

The default product set and their prices are determined by dotPhoto to be the most popular products at attractive prices. Most people start with this collection of products and prices and then adjust their own prices on their merchandise over time.

Yes. If you are only selling to friends and family, you may want to provide the ability to print photos for as little as possible. dotPhoto sells 4 by 6 prints for as little as 9 cents and provides very competitive prices on a wide variety of photo merchandise. To set the markup to zero, go to your dotPhoto pricing page.
